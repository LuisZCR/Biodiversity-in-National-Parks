# Biodiversity in National Parks

Code Project

This project involves analyzing data from the National Parks Services about endangered species in different parks.

### Project Goal

The goal of this project is to make a biodiversity analysis about a data from Natioanl Parks. Natural Parks wants to ensure the survival of endangered species, to mantain the level of biodiversity inside their park. For that, this project make a analysis  on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered.

### Project Data

This project has two datasets, the first one has information about each species and the second one has observations of the species on each park. Data by Codeacademy.com

### Analysis

To understand better the data, the project will focus on distributions, number of species, relationship between them, conservation status and observation of the species on each park.

### Evaluation

Acording to the project goals, the output of the anlysis needs to be check to see if there are any pattern found, the distribution of the species and some extra conclusions. In this section we will analyze whether we should have used a different methodology to make the project.
